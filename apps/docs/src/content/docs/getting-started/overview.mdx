ScholarMCP is an MCP server that exposes literature-research tooling to MCP-compatible clients.

## Core Capabilities

- Federated paper search across OpenAlex, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, and optional Scholar scraping
- Google Scholar keyword and advanced search flows
- Author profile lookup on Google Scholar
- Full-text ingestion pipeline with parser fallbacks (`grobid -> sidecar -> simple`)
- Structured extraction for claims, methods, datasets, metrics, and references
- Citation recommendation, bibliography generation, and citation validation

## Runtime Modes

- `stdio` (recommended): launched by your MCP client as a local process
- `http`: persistent server with MCP endpoint and health route
- `both`: run stdio + HTTP at the same time

## Typical Workflow

1. Search for relevant literature
2. Ingest and parse target papers
3. Extract structured findings from parsed documents
4. Generate references and validate manuscript citations
