## Workflow 1: Literature Review Sweep

1. Run `search_literature_graph` with a focused query and year range.
2. Refine with `sources` and `fields_of_study` if result quality is mixed.
3. Use `search_google_scholar_advanced` when you need stricter author/year/phrase filtering.
4. Save shortlisted papers for ingestion.

Prompt example:

> Find 15 papers from 2022-2026 on retrieval-augmented generation evaluation methods. Prioritize benchmark-heavy studies.

## Workflow 2: Full-Text Extraction Pipeline

1. Start ingestion with `ingest_paper_fulltext` using DOI, paper URL, direct PDF URL, or local PDF path.
2. Poll with `get_ingestion_status` until `succeeded`.
3. Extract structured outputs with `extract_granular_paper_details`.
4. Use extracted claims, methods, and limitations in your notes or draft.

Prompt example:

> Ingest DOI `10.1038/s41467-024-55563-6`, wait until complete, then extract methods, datasets, and limitations.

## Workflow 3: Citation Support for Drafts

1. Feed manuscript text into `suggest_contextual_citations`.
2. Generate formatted references via `build_reference_list`.
3. Validate inline citations and references using `validate_manuscript_citations`.
4. Iterate until missing/duplicate citation issues are resolved.

Prompt example:

> Suggest citations for this draft section in IEEE style, then build BibTeX and validate consistency.

## Workflow 4: Author-Centric Discovery

1. Use `get_author_info` to resolve the author and top publications.
2. Expand from those publications using `search_literature_graph`.
3. Ingest the highest-value papers and extract structured summaries.
