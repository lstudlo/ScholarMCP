## Design Goals

- Keep source code and docs in one repository
- Generate reference docs from implementation to minimize drift
- Preserve existing npm package release workflow
- Optimize docs deployment on Cloudflare Pages with branch previews

## Key Directories

- `packages/scholar-mcp/src/`: MCP server implementation
- `scripts/`: docs generation scripts
- `apps/docs/`: Astro Starlight site
- `services/python-sidecar/`: optional parsing sidecar service
