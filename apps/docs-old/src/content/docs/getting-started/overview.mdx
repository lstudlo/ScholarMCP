ScholarMCP is an MCP server for literature research workflows, shipping tools for search, ingestion, extraction, citation suggestion, bibliography generation, and citation validation.

This docs site is integrated into the same repository as source code so API docs and release notes can be generated from the same commit history and codebase.

## Repository Integration Model

- Source package lives in `packages/scholar-mcp`
- Docs app lives in `apps/docs`
- API reference is generated from `packages/scholar-mcp/src/mcp/create-scholar-mcp-server.ts`
- Release notes are generated from git tags
