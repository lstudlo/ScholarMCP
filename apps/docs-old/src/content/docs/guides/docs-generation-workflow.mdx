Generated artifacts are produced by repository-level scripts:

- `scripts/generate-docs-api.mjs`
- `scripts/generate-docs-releases.mjs`

Outputs:

- `apps/docs/src/generated/mcp-tools.json`
- `apps/docs/src/generated/releases.json`
- `apps/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-tools.mdx`
- `apps/docs/src/content/docs/releases/index.mdx`

These scripts run automatically in docs `dev`, `check`, and `build` commands.
